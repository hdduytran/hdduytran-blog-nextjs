I initiated my journey in the realm of programming during my eighth-grade year. Subsequently, during my high school years, I pursued my studies within the specialized domain of Informatics. This period of academic exploration profoundly influenced my decision to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the university level. Presently, I am employed as a Software Engineer.

My exposure to competitive programming during high school equipped me with a robust foundation in algorithms and data structures. At the university, I delved into the field of Computer Science, with a particular focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. As of now, I am employed as a Data Engineer. My aspirations extend beyond a single specialization, and I am open to the possibility of transitioning into the role of a Backend Engineer in order to expand my knowledge and contribute to the development of high-quality products.
